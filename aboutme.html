 <p> My name is Nick Alexandris , i was born in May of 1997, i am an Electrical Engineer and Web Developer , who mostly work on Electrical Isntallations/Plans and Front End Development.
I love working teams because i love human interaction and synergy , but i also enjoy working solo on projects. I am co-operative, patient and persistent.
I dont look at work just as a way of making money but mostly as a chance to be useful and creative.
I like to constantly learn evolve and adapt. </p>
